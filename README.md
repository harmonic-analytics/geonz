## Overview

This package provides datasets of the annually released geographic area
boundaries of New Zealand. The datasets are stored as simple features
data tables.

Currently, the **geonz** package houses datasets for the boundaries for
five geographic area types as set at 1 January 2018: statistical area 1,
statistical area 2, ward, territorial authority and regional council.
The package also contains versions of these boundaries clipped to the
coastline that can be used for map creation/cartographic purposes.

## Installation

Install this package using the `remotes` package:

``` r
remotes::install_github("harmonic-analytics/geonz")
```
