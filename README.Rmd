## Overview

This package provides datasets of the annually released geographic area
boundaries of New Zealand. The datasets are stored as simple features data
tables.

Currently, the __geonz__ package houses datasets for the boundaries for five
geographic area types as set at 1 January 2018: statistical area 1, statistical
area 2, ward, territorial authority and regional council. The package also
contains versions of these boundaries clipped to the coastline that can be used
for map creation/cartographic purposes.

## Installation

Install this package using the `remotes` package:

```r
remotes::install_github("harmonic-analytics/geonz")
```
