This package provides datasets of the annually released geographic area boundaries of New Zealand. The datasets are stored as simple features data tables.

Currently, the geonz package houses datasets for the boundaries for five geographic area types as set at 1 January 2018: statistical area 1, statistical area 2, ward, territorial authority and regional council. The package also contains versions of these boundaries clipped to the coastline that can be used for map creation/cartographic purposes.
